# OfficeFree65

Script that easily activates and installs the latest microsoft office 365. <br>
The installed office will have full support for <b>Microsoft Sign In, Settings Sync, Addins, Connected Services like OneDrive, Office Updates directly from Microsoft (on Insider, DevMode and Standard channels)</b> and basically every other feature in office 365 apart from the 1TB Cloud Storage. <br>
It installs the following apps: <br> <br>
Microsoft Office Word <br>
Microsoft Office Powerpoint <br>
Microsoft Office Publisher <br>
Microsoft Office Access <br>
Microsoft Office Outlook <br>
Microsoft Office OneNote <br>
Microsoft Office Excel <br>
Microsoft Skype for Business <br>
Microsoft Office Project <br>
Microsoft Office Visio <br>
<br>

### Why does it say "Microsoft Office Mondo 2016" on the activation page?
Being a monthly activation subscription, KMS activation dosen't work well when you try to activate the product as a 365 subscription. Activating as Mondo 2016 fixes that. <b> You will still receive all features and feature updates as Office 365 ProPlus.</b>

<br>
Support for Office 365 Insider builds and Alpha (DevMode) builds added in 2.0.0. <br>
Support for optionally deactivating specific components planned. <br>
<br>
Go to the releases tab to download.
<br>
Main repo with sources for the components is at: https://codeberg.org/3rik/OfficeFree65
<br>
This page should recieve updates on the releases channel a couple minutes after codeberg, but you may still want to check there for a newer version just in case.

## Bugs
I'm still a noob by most developer's standards, so there may be issues I haven't noticed yet, although I have tried to iron out as many as possible. Please report them here on the issues tab, or for a possibly faster reponse, at https://codeberg.org/3rik/OfficeFree65/issues.

## Credits
The credits for most of this project go to the developers of Yet Another Office Click To Run Installer and KMS activator. This is also based on a guide here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-4oqnyomXCibQfOJkYbLqeKTmO7ApoGRk_EscaWnEk/preview which achieves the same but has more steps involved.
<br>
All I did was simplify the process a bit by putting it into one script that does most of the work for you.
